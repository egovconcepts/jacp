#JACP JavaFX2-Project install tutorial

= Create a running JACP JavaFX2 project =

== Prerequisites: ==
   * make shure you have a working maven install (type in terminal mvn -version), otherwise download [http://maven.apache.org/download.html here]
   * if you are working on windows, make shure you have svn installed, otherwise download [http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download here]
   * currently the projects are tested with Java 1.6
   * download and install JavaFX2 SDK from [http://javafx.com/downloads/all.jsp here]
   * all steps are tested with Eclipse 3.6/3.7, optionally you can install m2eclipse plugin from market
   * due to the lack of Linux support by JavaFX2 you must use windows or mac ;-)





== install jfxrt.jar to your local maven repository ==

   * go to your JavaFX2 install location (C:\Program Files\Oracle\JavaFX 2.0 SDK\rt\lib)
   * *type:* {{{ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jfxrt.jar -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=javafx-runtime -Dpackaging=jar -Dversion=2.0}}}
   * on windows you need to copy the JavaFX2 {{{*.dll's}}} to maven repository
   * copy (the bin folder) *C:\Program Files\Oracle\JavaFX 2.0 SDK\rt\bin* to  *C:\Users\YOURUSER\.m2\repository\com\oracle\javafx-runtime*

== checkout the projects ==
   * go to terminal type: *svn checkout http://jacp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ * 
   * now your root folder should contain 4 sub folders (*JACP, JACP.API, JACP.Concurrency, JACP.JavaFX2 and JACP.JavaFX2*)

== build and install projetcs ==
   * go to JACP folder (the root project folder)
   * type *mvn clean install -Pall* this builds all projects

== create eclipse nature and import to workspace ==
   * go to each of the 4 folders and type mvn eclipse:eclipse
   * go to your workspace in eclipse, right click on the "ProjectExplorer" and select "Existing Projects into Workspace" 
   * choose now the folder containing the JACP project and import
