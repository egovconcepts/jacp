The JACP JavaFX Project is an API to create Rich Clients in MVC style with JavaFX 2. It provides a simple API to create a workspace, perspectives, components and to compose your Client application easily.  All components behave like controllers and triggered by messages similar to Spring MVC controllers. Components have a defined life cycle, their handle() methods is always executed in a separate thread, so the developer do not to have to manage own threading mechanism or be afraid of locking and unresponsive UI. The API uses dependency injection to initialize all parts of your client; the currently used DI implementation is Spring. It is possible to inject “normal” spring beans to your component and to use the complete Spring stack in your JACP Application.

The “Application Launcher” is the entry point where you define the spring xml and where the complete stack of spring, JavaFX 2 and JACP  is started. It defines a main method so you have to declare your xml in the launchers constructor and can start the project.  The structure of a JACP/Spring application looks like this:
