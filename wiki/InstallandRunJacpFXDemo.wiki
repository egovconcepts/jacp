= Install JacpFX Demo project from source =

If you simply want to run the demo, run it on this site  [http://developer.ahcp.de/demo/JACPFX2Demo.html]. Here you can see an embedded Version and also start the jnlp.

== Build the project from source ==
Follow the following steps to compile and run the demo. All Jacp(FX)Project are maven projects and require JavaFX 2 libs as dependencies. Some include JavaFX 2 as system dependencs but I like more to register the JavaFX libs in the local repository. So, similar to [JacpFX2InstallTutorial] (you should check the Prerequisites), register the jfxrt.jar and ant-javafx.jar to your local maven repository.

   * When you installed jfxrt.jar and ant-javafx.jar sucessfully download and unpack the JacpFXDemo.zip
   * go to JacpFXDemo directory and run/type *{{{mvn install}}}*, this will generate a target/deploy folder where you can find the html and the jnlp file to run the demo
   * if you want to create an Eclipse project simply type:*{{{ mvn eclipse:eclipse}}}*, after imported the project to your workbench run the {{{ContactMain.java}}} class.
