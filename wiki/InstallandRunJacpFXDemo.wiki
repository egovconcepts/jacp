= Install JacpFX Demo project from source =

If you simply want to run the demo, run it on this site  [http://developer.ahcp.de/demo/JACPFX2Demo.html]. Here you can see an embedded Version and also start the jnlp. The online demo is currently only available for windows. With official release of JavaFX on Mac and Linux it should run everywhere. Mac and Linux Users should download the JavaFX beta versions and build the project from source.

== Build the project from source ==
Follow the following steps to compile and run the demo. All JacpFX-Projects are maven projects and require JavaFX 2 (jfxrt.jar). Some include JavaFX 2 as system dependency but I prefer to register the jfxrt.jar in the local repository. So, similar to [JacpFX2InstallTutorial] (you should check the Prerequisites), register the jfxrt.jar and ant-javafx.jar to your local maven repository.

   * When you installed jfxrt.jar and ant-javafx.jar sucessfully download and unpack the JacpFXDemo.zip
   * go to JacpFXDemo directory and run/type *{{{mvn install}}}*, this will generate a target/deploy folder where you can find the html and the jnlp file to run the demo
   * if you want to create an Eclipse project simply type:*{{{ mvn eclipse:eclipse}}}*, after imported the project to your workbench run the {{{ContactMain.java}}} class.
