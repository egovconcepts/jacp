#about me.

I am an experienced Java developer having fun in coding, engineering and [http://www.flickr.com/photos/30866998@N07/ photography]. Although my current job is focused on business development I do enjoy playing with all kind of JVM languages, frameworks and operating system … nearly everything what you can do with a computer. My current obsession is to create an Application Framework that addresses some major problems in current Application development: “Where to get an easy to use, extensible Application skeleton and how can I create large scaling Applications, without having fear to end up in crazy deadlock situations”. To achieve this I do fight on three big fields: 
 # Find a set of interfaces which are suitable to be implemented on different UI-Toolkits (Swing, SWT, Echo2/3, Vaadin) AND are easy to use for application development
 # Create different non blocking implementations based on the interface set
 # Create a micro core structure that handles component lifecycle in a multithreaded environment and outside the current JVM borders

If you are interested in my work or you are looking for an enthusiastic and experienced developer, than get in contact with me.
