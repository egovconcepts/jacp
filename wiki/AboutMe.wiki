Although my current job is focused on Java business development I do enjoy discovering all kind of programming languages, frameworks and operating systemsâ€¦ and nearly everything what you can do with a computer. Motivated by learning every day I love new and interesting techniques, tools and methodologies. Clean code, quality and testing is obvious in all my projects. My current obsession is to discover the boundaries of software scalability and to provide a straightforward access for all who wants to create efficiently applications and a great user experience. I enjoy working in teams of specialist, to use and to profit of the collective intelligence and the knowledge of each individual involved. Being a bit upset to leave the the grate research teams at TU Dresden  I am always looking for new challenges to keep my brain busy and fit.
