== committing tasks in a component ==
Normally you can send a message to an background component or the component itself to achieve handling of a long running task in a thread. If you send a message to a background component the message sourceID (sending comonent) acts as message targetId for the return value of the background component.

Possilbe enhancement: Submit a runnable to your component, the return value is handled by an message to you


== distinguish the types of components using a enums ==

All Components are implementing same base interface (IComponent), but in some situations the responsible component have to know the type of component (uicomponent, bgstatecomponent,...). Add an abstract method to IComponent which returns the type of this component based on enumerations.
